			<h1>Rubber plants (Ficus elastica) are popular indoor houseplants known for their 
			attractive, glossy leaves and low-maintenance care requirements. Here are some 
			general guidelines to help you take care of your rubber plant:</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Light</h2>
			<p>• Rubber plants prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate some direct sunlight. 
			Avoid exposing them to harsh, intense sunlight for extended periods, as this can scorch the leaves.</p>
			<p>• If your rubber plant is in low-light conditions, it may still survive, but growth may slow down.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Watering</h2>
			<p>• Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering. Overwatering can lead to 
			root rot, so it's crucial not to let the plant sit in waterlogged soil.</p>
			<p>• Water less during the winter when the plant is in a dormant phase and doesn't 
			require as much moisture.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>• Use well-draining potting mix that retains some moisture but doesn't become soggy. 
			A mix formulated for tropical plants or a general-purpose potting mix works well.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
			<p>• Rubber plants prefer temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C). They can tolerate 
			slightly cooler temperatures but are sensitive to drafts.</p>
			<p>• Maintain moderate to high humidity if possible, but they can adapt to lower humidity levels.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Fertilization</h2>
			<p>• Feed your rubber plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season 
			(spring and summer) every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilizing during the fall and winter 
			when the plant is not actively growing.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Pruning</h2>
			<p>• Prune your rubber plant to control its size and shape. Trim any yellow or damaged 
			leaves with clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears.</p>
		<div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Repotting</h2>
			<p>• Rubber plants generally prefer to be slightly root-bound, so you don't need to 
			repot frequently. Repot if the roots are becoming too crowded or the plant is outgrowing 
			its container.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
			<p>• Keep an eye out for pests such as spider mites, scale, or mealybugs. If you notice 
			any infestations, treat them promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Cleaning</h2>
			<p>• Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust. This helps the plant absorb more 
			light and stay healthier.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Support</h2>
			<p>• Provide support for tall or leggy rubber plants by staking them to prevent them 
			from tipping over.</p>
