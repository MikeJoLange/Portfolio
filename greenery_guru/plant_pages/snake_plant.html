			<h1>Taking care of a snake plant (Sansevieria) is relatively easy, as these plants are 
			known for their resilience and adaptability. Here's a detailed guide on how to care for 
			a snake plant:</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Light</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants can tolerate a wide range of light conditions. They can thrive in low 
			light but prefer indirect sunlight.</p>
			<p>• Place your snake plant in a location where it can receive bright, indirect light. 
			It can also adapt to lower light conditions, but growth may be slower.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Watering</h2>
			<p>• Allow the top inch or two of the soil to dry out before watering. Snake plants are 
			quite drought-tolerant and can survive in dry conditions.</p>
			<p>• Water sparingly, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Ensure good drainage, and 
			empty the saucer beneath the pot to prevent waterlogging.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>• Use a well-draining potting mix. A cactus or succulent mix is suitable, or you can 
			add perlite or sand to regular potting soil to enhance drainage.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants are adaptable to various temperature ranges. They prefer temperatures 
			between 70-90°F (21-32°C) but can tolerate lower temperatures.</p>
			<p>• They can thrive in average indoor humidity levels and do not require additional humidity.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Fertilization</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants don't need frequent fertilizing. During the growing season 
			(spring and summer), you can apply a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks.</p>
			<p>• Reduce or eliminate fertilizer in the fall and winter when the plant's growth slows down.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pruning">
			<h2>Pruning</h2>
			<p>• Prune yellow or damaged leaves at the base using clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears. 
			Regular pruning helps maintain the plant's appearance.</p>
		<div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Repotting</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants generally don't need frequent repotting. Repot if the plant has outgrown 
			its container or if the soil has become depleted.</p>
			<p>• Spring or early summer is the best time for repotting. Use fresh potting mix, and choose 
			a container with good drainage.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants are generally resistant to pests and diseases. Keep an eye out for mealybugs 
			or spider mites, and treat promptly if you notice any infestations.</p>
			<p>• Wipe the leaves occasionally with a damp cloth to remove dust.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Propagation</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants can be easily propagated by division or leaf cuttings. Allow cuttings to 
			callus for a day or two before planting them in soil.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Indoor Conditions</h2>
			<p>• Snake plants are well-suited for indoor environments. They can tolerate low light, 
			making them ideal for offices and homes with limited sunlight.</p>
			<p>• Avoid exposing them to drafts or extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
