			<h1>Fiddle leaf figs (Ficus lyrata) are popular indoor plants known for their large, 
			glossy leaves. Proper care is essential to keep them healthy and thriving. Here are 
			some guidelines to help you take care of your fiddle leaf fig:</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Light</h2>
			<p>• Provide bright, indirect light. Fiddle leaf figs thrive in bright, filtered light 
			but should be shielded from harsh direct sunlight, as it can scorch their leaves.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Watering</h2>
			<p>• Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering. Overwatering is a common 
			issue, so it's crucial to let the soil dry slightly between waterings.</p>
			<p>• Water the plant thoroughly, but make sure excess water can drain from the pot. Ensure 
			there are drainage holes in the container to prevent waterlogging.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>• Use a well-draining potting mix that retains some moisture but doesn't become 
			waterlogged. A mix formulated for tropical plants or a combination of potting soil, 
			perlite, and orchid bark works well.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
			<p>• Keep your fiddle leaf fig in a warm environment. They prefer temperatures between 
			60-75°F (15-24°C).</p>
			<p>• Maintain moderate to high humidity. You can increase humidity by misting the leaves, 
			placing a tray of water nearby, or using a humidifier.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Fertilization</h2>
			<p>• Fertilize regularly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced 
			liquid fertilizer. Reduce or eliminate fertilization in the fall and winter when the 
			plant is in a dormant phase.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Pruning</h2>
			<p>• Prune your fiddle leaf fig to maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth. 
			Remove any damaged or yellowing leaves.</p>
			<p>• If your plant becomes leggy, you can prune the top to encourage branching.</p>
		<div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Repotting</h2>
			<p>• Repot your fiddle leaf fig if it becomes root-bound or outgrows its container. 
			Repotting is typically needed every 1-2 years.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
			<p>• Keep an eye out for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale insects. Treat 
			any infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oilide bright, indirect light. 
			Fiddle leaf figs thrive in bright, filtered light but should be shielded from harsh 
			direct sunlight, as it can scorch their leaves.</p>

		<div>
			<h2>Cleaning</h2>
			<p>• Wipe the leaves gently with a damp cloth to remove dust. Clean leaves allow better 
			light absorption.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Support</h2>
			<p>• Fiddle leaf figs can grow tall and may benefit from staking for support. Use a 
			sturdy stake and ties to secure the plant if needed.</p>
