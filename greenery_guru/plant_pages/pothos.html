			<h1>Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) is a popular and easy-to-care-for houseplant known for its 
			attractive trailing vines and heart-shaped leaves. Here are some general guidelines for 
			taking care of a pothos:1</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Light</h2>
			<p>• Pothos plants thrive in moderate to low light conditions, making them suitable for 
			various indoor environments.</p>
			<p>• They can tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can scorch the leaves. Indirect 
			or filtered sunlight is ideal.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Watering</h2>
			<p>• Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering. Overwatering can lead to root rot.</p>
			<p>• Water the pothos thoroughly, and ensure excess water can drain away. Empty the saucer under the 
			pot to prevent waterlogging.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>• Use a well-draining potting mix with a good balance of organic matter. A general-purpose indoor 
			plant mix works well.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
			<p>• Pothos prefers temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) and can tolerate slightly cooler conditions.</p>
			<p>• They can adapt to average household humidity levels, but they thrive in higher 
			humidity. Mist the leaves occasionally or place a tray of water near the plant to increase humidity.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Fertilization</h2>
			<p>• Feed your pothos with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the 
			growing season (spring and summer).</p>
			<p>• Reduce or stop fertilizing in the fall and winter when the plant's growth slows down.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Pruning</h2>
			<p>• Trim back long vines to encourage bushier growth and maintain a more compact shape.</p>
			<p>• Regular pruning can also help remove any yellow or damaged leaves.</p>
		<div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Repotting</h2>
			<p>• Repot your pothos when it outgrows its current container or the soil becomes depleted. 
			This is typically done every 1-2 years.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
			<p>• Pothos are generally resistant to pests, but occasionally, they may attract mealybugs 
			or spider mites. Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove pests, and if needed, treat 
			with insecticidal soap.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Propagation</h2>
			<p>• Pothos is easy to propagate. You can root cuttings in water or directly in soil. 
			Snip a healthy vine just below a node and place it in water or soil until roots develop.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Support</h2>
			<p>• Pothos is a climbing plant, and it may benefit from some support. You can provide 
			a small trellis or let it trail down from a hanging basket.</p>
