			<h1>Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum spp.) are popular indoor plants known for their attractive 
			foliage and white, sail-like flowers. Taking care of a peace lily involves providing the 
			right conditions for growth, watering, fertilizing, and addressing any potential issues. 
			Here's a guide on how to care for a peace lily:</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Light</h2>
			<p>• Peace lilies prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light conditions. 
			Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight, as it can scorch their leaves.</p>
			<p>• If the leaves start to turn yellow, it may be an indication that the plant is 
			receiving too much light.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Watering</h2>
			<p>• Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Peace lilies prefer to be kept 
			evenly moist, so water them when the top inch of the soil feels dry.</p>
			<p>• If the leaves droop, it's a sign that the plant needs water. Water it thoroughly, 
			and the leaves should perk up within a few hours.</p>
			<p>• Reduce watering during the winter months when the plant's growth slows down.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>• Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix. A mix designed for orchids or aroid 
			plants can work well.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
			<p>• They prefer temperatures between 65-80°F (18-27°C) and are sensitive to drafts and 
			sudden temperature changes. Avoid placing them near air vents, drafts, or open windows 
			during cold weather.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Fertilization</h2>
			<p>• Feed peace lilies with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing 
			season (spring and summer) every 6-8 weeks. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended 
			strength.</p>
			<p>• During the dormant season (fall and winter), you can reduce or stop fertilizing.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Pruning</h2>
			<p>• Remove yellow or brown leaves promptly to encourage new growth and maintain the 
			plant's appearance.</p>
		<div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Repotting</h2>
			<p>• Peace lilies don't need frequent repotting. Repot when the plant becomes root-bound 
			or outgrows its current container, typically every 1-2 years.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
			<p>• Keep an eye out for pests like spider mites and scale insects. If you notice any, 
			treat them with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- <div>

		</div> -->
		
		<div>
			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<p>• If your peace lily is not flowering, it may be due to insufficient light or 
			over-fertilization. Adjust the light conditions and reduce the frequency of fertilization.</p>
