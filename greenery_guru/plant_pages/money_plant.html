			<h1>Money plants, also known as Pothos or Devil's Ivy (Epipremnum aureum), are popular 
			indoor plants that are relatively easy to care for. Here are some general guidelines 
			for taking care of a money plant:</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Light</h2>
			<p>• Money plants can adapt to various light conditions, but they prefer bright, indirect 
			light. They can also tolerate low light.</p>
			<p>• Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Watering</h2>
			<p>• Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering. Overwatering can lead to 
			root rot, so it's essential not to keep the soil constantly soggy.</p>
			<p>• Water the plant thoroughly, and allow any excess water to drain away.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>• Money plants are not picky about soil, but they thrive in well-draining potting mix.</p>
			<p>• A mix of regular potting soil with perlite or orchid bark can work well.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
			<p>• Money plants prefer temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) and can tolerate a bit of 
			fluctuation.</p>
			<p>• They can adapt to average indoor humidity levels, but they do better in slightly 
			higher humidity.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Fertilization</h2>
			<p>• Feed your money plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the 
			growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter when 
			growth slows down.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Pruning</h2>
			<p>• Regular pruning helps control the size and shape of the plant. You can also remove 
			yellow or damaged leaves.</p>
			<p>• Pinch back the growing tips to encourage bushier growth.</p>
		<div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Repotting</h2>
			<p>• Repot the money plant when it outgrows its current container, typically every 
			1-2 years. Use fresh potting mix and a slightly larger pot.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
			<p>• Keep an eye out for common houseplant pests like spider mites or aphids. If you 
			notice any, treat them promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Propagation</h2>
			<p>• Money plants are easy to propagate. You can root cuttings in water or directly in soil.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Support</h2>
			<p>• Money plants are climbers and can benefit from support. You can provide a small 
			trellis or allow them to trail down from a hanging basket.</p>
