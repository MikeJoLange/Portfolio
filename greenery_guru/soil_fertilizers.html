	<h2>Potting Soil</h2>
	<h3>All-purpose Potting Mix:</h3>
	<p>An all-purpose potting mix is suitable for most indoor plants. Look for a well-balanced mix 
	that provides good drainage and aeration. It should typically contain a blend of peat moss, 
	perlite, vermiculite, and organic matter.</p>

	<h3>Cactus and Succulent Mix:</h3>
	<p>For plants like cacti and succulents that prefer drier conditions, use a potting mix 
	specifically formulated for these types of plants. These mixes usually have added sand or grit 
	to improve drainage.</p>


	<h2>Fertilizers</h2>
	<h3>Liquid Fertilizers:</h3>
	<p>Liquid fertilizers are popular for indoor plants because they are easy to apply and quickly 
	absorbed by the roots. Choose a balanced liquid fertilizer with equal proportions of nitrogen, 
	phosphorus, and potassium (N-P-K).</p>

	<h2>Slow-release Granular Fertilizers</h2>
	<p>Slow-release granular fertilizers provide nutrients to plants gradually over time. They are 
	convenient for indoor plants as they require less frequent application compared to liquid fertilizers.</p>

	<h3>Organic Fertilizers:</h3>
	<p>Organic fertilizers are derived from natural sources and are suitable for those who prefer to use 
	environmentally friendly products. Examples include compost, fish emulsion, seaweed extract, and worm castings.</p>

	<h3>Specialty Fertilizers:</h3>
	<p>Some indoor plants may have specific nutrient requirements. For example, acid-loving plants like 
	ferns and gardenias may benefit from fertilizers formulated for acid-loving plants.</p>
	<p>When using fertilizers, always follow the instructions on the packaging to avoid over-fertilizing, 
	which can harm your plants. Additionally, it's a good practice to periodically flush the soil with 
	water to prevent salt buildup from fertilizers.</p>
