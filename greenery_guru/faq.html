		<!-- Aloe Vera -->
		<h2><a href="plant_pages/aloe_vera.html">Aloe Vera</a></h2>
		<h3>Q</h3>
		<p class="question">Can aloe vera plants be grown hydroponically?</p>
		<h3>A</h3>
		<p>While aloe vera plants are typically grown in soil, they can be grown 
		hydroponically with the right setup. Hydroponic systems provide a soilless 
		environment where plants receive nutrients directly from water.</p>
	
		<h3>Q</h3>
		<p class="question">Do aloe vera plants attract any specific pests or insects? </p>
		<h3>A</h3>
		<p>While aloe vera plants are generally resistant to many pests and diseases, they 
		can occasionally attract certain insects such as aphids, spider mites, or mealybugs. 
		These pests may feed on the plant's sap or cause damage to the leaves. Natural 
		remedies or insecticidal soaps can be used to control pests if necessary.</p>

	
		<h3>Q</h3>
		<p class="question">Why are my Aloe Vera leaves turning yellow?</p>
		<h3>A</h3>
		<p>Yellowing leaves are often a sign of overwatering. Aloe vera plants are 
		drought-tolerant and prefer dry conditions, so if the soil remains consistently 
		moist, the roots may suffocate and rot, leading to yellowing leaves.</p>
