<!--<h1>Pest & Insects</h1>-->
	
	<p style="font-style:italic;">Indoor plants are not immune to pest infestations, and several common pests can affect them. 
	Here are some of the most prevalent pests that infest indoor plants:</p>
	
	<h2>Spider Mites</h2> 
	<p>Spider mites are tiny arachnids that suck sap from plant leaves, causing stippling, yellowing, 
	and eventually leaf drop. They produce fine webbing on the underside of leaves, which is often a 
	sign of infestation.</p>

	<h2>Mealybugs</h2>
	<p>Mealybugs are small, soft-bodied insects covered in a white, waxy substance. They feed on 
	plant sap and excrete honeydew, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold. Mealybugs often hide 
	in leaf axils and 1other protected areas.</p>

	<h2>Aphids</h2>
	<p>Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that come in various colors, including green, black, 
	brown, and red. They feed on plant sap and reproduce quickly, causing distorted growth, yellowing 
	leaves, and stunted plants.</p>

	<h2>Scale Insects</h2>
	<p>Scale insects are often mistaken for plant growths due to their immobile, shell-like appearance. 
	They feed on plant sap and can cause yellowing, wilting, and premature leaf drop. Scale insects can 
	be challenging to control once established.</p>

	<h2>Fungus Gnats</h2>
	<p>Fungus gnats are small, black flies that lay their eggs in moist soil. The larvae feed on organic 
	matter and root hairs, potentially damaging the plant's root system. Adult fungus gnats are attracted 
	to light and can be seen flying around plants.</p>

	<h2>Whiteflies</h2>
	<p>Whiteflies are small, moth-like insects with powdery white wings. They feed on plant sap and 
	produce honeydew, leading to the growth of sooty mold. Whiteflies can quickly infest indoor plants 
	and are challenging to control.</p>

	<h2>Thrips:</h2>
	<p>Thrips are tiny, slender insects that feed on plant tissues by piercing and sucking. They cause 
	silvery or bronze-colored streaks on leaves, as well as distorted growth and flower damage.<br/><br/></p>
	
	<p>Controlling indoor plant pests often involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical 
	methods. These can include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Regularly inspecting plants for signs of pests.</li>
			<li>Isolating infested plants to prevent the spread of pests.</li>
			<li>Removing pests manually using a gentle stream of water or by wiping leaves with a damp cloth.</li>
			<li>Using insecticidal soaps, neem oil, or horticultural oils to control pests.</li>
			<li>Introducing natural predators such as ladybugs or predatory mites to control pest populations.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>It's essential to address pest infestations promptly to prevent damage to your indoor plants 
	and minimize the risk of further spread to other plants.</p>
